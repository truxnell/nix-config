## Modules

A set of 'custom' modules with the aim to enable easy on/off/settings to build up a system modulary to my 'specs'.

The main goal is to build up a `mySystem` options key which is easy to read and toggle functionality on and off.

This option key will largely be manipulated by a profile to build up a host to a base, then toggle specific options from there.

I will _try_ and only do modules for things I want to be able to configure, and just use nixos config directly for some simple static things.
